\begin{abstract}
We present the Multi-participant Interactive Trading (MINT) platform, a novel and versatile experimental environment for studying trading behaviour in continuous double-auction markets. Designed for researchers in experimental economics and finance, MINT supports both human–human and human–machine trading interactions, enabling flexible experimental treatments involving algorithmic traders. The platform is built using the Python programming language and ensures transparency, flexibility, and ease of customisation, allowing researchers to integrate custom trading algorithms and modify experimental parameters through an Administrative Interface Dashboard. MINT automatically records detailed Level 3 (L3) quote data, including all order submissions and message logs, facilitating comprehensive analyses of market and order book dynamics, as well as individual participant behaviour. The platform can also be easily integrated with participant recruitment services such as Prolific. Future developments will include enhanced front-end interfaces for real-time information display and GPT-based decision systems to explore AI-assisted trading behaviour.
